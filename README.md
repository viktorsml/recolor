# Recolor

Do you have a progressive web application installed with [Edge (Chromium)](https://microsoft.com/edge) and want to change the [color of the title bar](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/discussions/new-feature-in-microsoft-edge-pwa-progressive-web-apps-custom/m-p/1207256)? This simple extension does exactly that, if a PWA doesn't have the color bar you like you can change it with this extension to any color you like.
